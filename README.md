# Maths Analysis and Approaches HL Internal assessment
## Exploring the Travelling Salesperson problem
### Introduction
One day our CAS advisor was talking to us about all the CAS projects that we can take up in the school. Each senior leading the project would come up and give a brief description about the project. Now you may ask what is so great about that. One project that stuck with me was a project where we would help the person who delivers coffee around the school learn new skills. How could that in any way be related to a maths IA? It was not so much the project that stimulated my curiosity. It was the current job of the individual: delivering coffees. I distinctly recall thinking to myself if I was in his shoes what path would I take in order to optimise my coffee delivery locations around school? This led me to explore the problem for my Maths IA.
To formulate the problem I utilised google maps to mark locations around my school and utilised the measuring tool to get the distance between the points.
